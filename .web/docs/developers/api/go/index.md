# Go

::: warning Go Applications
While Go applications can use this HTTP API as well, we recommend using Gate's native Go library (see [Introduction](/developers/)) as it provides the most complete and type-safe access to Gate's functionality, unless you need out-of-process execution or want to iterate and deploy updates independently from your proxy.
